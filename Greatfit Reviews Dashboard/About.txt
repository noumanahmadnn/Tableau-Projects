Greatfit is an online e-commerce store that sells ladies clothing. They make a lot of sales through various
platforms. Customers generally leave reviews and Greatfit hasn't been doing any analytics and investigation
in the reviews.

The Customer Service manager has asked you to develop a dashboard to give her an idea of how the
reviews are. She wants the following

1. Do they get a lot of negative/positive reviews?
2. Analysis on the reviews by division
3. Do people recommend their products?
4. Do reviews mention anything about returning items?
